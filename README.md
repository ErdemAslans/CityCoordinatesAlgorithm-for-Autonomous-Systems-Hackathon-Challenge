# CityCoordinatesAlgorithm for Autonomous Systems: Hackathon Challenge

An innovative solution for optimizing routes in autonomous systems by solving the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using advanced algorithms and interactive visualizations.

---

## Overview

This project is designed to tackle the classical TSP problem, commonly applied in logistics, robotics, and autonomous systems. By comparing multiple optimization algorithms, the project demonstrates:

- **Efficient Routing Algorithms** for TSP solutions.
- **Interactive Visualizations** of cities and calculated tours.
- **Performance Analysis** of different heuristics and metaheuristics.

---

## Features

- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A quick and simple heuristic to generate an initial solution.
  - **3-Opt Improvement:** Enhances the tour by performing local swaps for better paths.
  - **Lin-Kernighan Heuristic:** Advanced optimization to achieve near-optimal solutions.

- **Performance Comparison**:
  - Evaluates algorithms by tour length and computation time.

- **Visualization**:
  - Cities and tours are plotted interactively using Plotly.

- **Scalable and Modular**:
  - Can handle diverse datasets and extend to other optimization problems.

   1      15.5         30.5
   ...
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python CityCoordinatesAlgorithm.py
   ```
